Matt's AS3 Library

--------------------------------------------------

v4.0.4
* StateMangager.as StateMangagerStarling.as are no longer singletons. They are now used as re-usable classes.
  But added a comment to create an interface that emulates a static version of the same thing.
* Added a Database.as helper class the deals with SQLite.

--------------------------------------------------

v4.0.3
StateMangager.as now takes a DisplayObjectContainer instead of a Stage as the holder for states etc. To match StateMangagerStarling.as

--------------------------------------------------

v4.0.2
Latest version of starling
StateManager & StateManagerStarling removed the removeClassPrefixFunction as it's not required, and slowed down state changing

--------------------------------------------------

v4.0.1
StateMangagerStarling.as now takes a DisplayObjectContainer instead of a Stage as the holder for states etc.

--------------------------------------------------
v4.0.0
This is the base point from which I will tidy up the library, removing any unnecessary classes etc.
