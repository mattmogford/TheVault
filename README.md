Matt's AS3 Library


v4.0.0
This is the base point from which I will tidy up the library, removing any unnecessary classes etc.

v4.0.1
StateMangagerStarling.as now takes a DisplayObjectContainer instead of a Stage as the holder for states etc.

v4.0.2
Latest version of starling
StateManager & StateManagerStarling removed the removeClassPrefixFunction as it's not required, and slowed down state changing

v4.0.3
StateMangager.as now takes a DisplayObjectContainer instead of a Stage as the holder for states etc. To match StateMangagerStarling.as
